This is due to the higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated."

The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art."
